The challenges folder will have upsolves and writeups from ctfs that will cover these challenges


### 1.Basic Ciphers 
#### a)Caesar Cipher
Shifts a string of letters a certain number of positions up or down the alphabet
E.g- ```Flag{Caesar} => Mshn{Jhlzhy}```, here a shift of 7 has been applied

#### b)VigenÃ¨re Cipher
Similar to caesar cipher but uses a different pairing to encrypt

#### c)Substitution Cipher
Each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another letter, symbol, or number;
##### Tools- [Alphabetica Decoder](https://cryptii.com/pipes/alphabetical-substitution)
#### d)Bacon Cipher
A substitution cipher in which each letter is replaced by a sequence of 5 characters.
E.g- ```Flag{bacon} => aabab ababa aaaaa aabba aaaab aaaaa aaaba abbab abbaa``` 
here a shift of 7 has been applied.
